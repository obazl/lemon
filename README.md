Bazel build of lemon parser-generator

**WARNING** Contains one minor (three line) Bazel-motivated change.
With the -m flag, the generated lexer contains a #define for the
header to be generated by makefiles. Originally this was an absolute
path, but that's a problem if you need to move files around. So I
altered that; this version just emits the header file name with no
path. It's up to the build system to make it work. The changes are
marked by 'obazl' in lemon.c.
